🏡 California Housing Price Prediction
This project is a machine learning pipeline built to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. It covers the entire workflow — from data exploration and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

The notebook includes:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing

🏗️ Custom transformer creation using Scikit-Learn

🔁 Full pipeline integration

📈 Regression model training and evaluation

This project is inspired by the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow book by Aurélien Géron. All code is written from scratch to reinforce practical ML skills.
